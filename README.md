This is the Obsidian vault I'm using to study for the [AZ-400](AZ-400.md) exam. I'll be updating it with my notes and use them to try to make sense of it all.

I have decided to not use most of the Microsoft Learn paths to study (only if absolutely necessary) because they take way too much time to study completely and even if you study all of them there will still be a big gap in what you know vs. what the exam expects you to know. For this exam I'll be using a mixture of external sources and practice exam questions

- Days until exam: 60?
